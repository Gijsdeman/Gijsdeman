### Hello, my name is Gijs de Man!

I am a third year Bachelor's Computer Science student at the Eindhoven University of Technology and active member of the [study association GEWIS][GEWIS], the study association of the department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the Eindhoven University of Technology.

I am quite busy with personal development, and hence have some personal (but also university-related) projects that are available on this Github. An example of such an project is [my website][website]. Besides this, I am a hard-working person and always try to get the best out of myself. I don't like cutting corners and strive to deliver the absolute best I can. I have a clear vision of what I want and I'm not faced by a challenge.

As part of nominally acquiring my propaedeutic, I'm currently part of the TU/e Honors Academy which specializes in Competitive Programming and Problem-Solving. On top of that, I'm part of various committees at both GEWIS and TU/e, which are related to the quality of the education and keeping the corporate identity up to date. I'm developing my organizational skills and try to broaden my network by any means possible.
