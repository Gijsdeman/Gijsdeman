### Hello, my name is Gijs de Man!

I am a third year Bachelor's Computer Science student at the [Eindhoven University of Technology][tue] and active member of the [study association GEWIS][GEWIS], the study association of the department of Mathematics and Computer Science of the university.

I am quite busy with personal development, and hence have some personal (but also university-related) projects that are available on this GitHub. An example of such an project is [my website][website]. Furthermore, I am a hard-working person and always try to get the best out of myself. I don't like cutting corners and strive to deliver the absolute best I can. I have a clear vision of what I want and I'm not faced by a challenge.
